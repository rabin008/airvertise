# Instructions to generate diagrams

Go to https://plantuml.com/ and select the type of diagram you want to create. Work on that site and once you're done:

* Create a `.puml` file in this folder containing the code
* Upload the resulting `.png` image

NOTE: you can also install a few VSCode extensions to write the code and render it locally in your laptop.
